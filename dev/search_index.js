Each array will have two directions (positive and negative) and up to three space dimensions (x,y,z). After the definition of the connection between different faces, out-of-boundary indexes will be permitted. The CyclicArray structure includes two fields - data array and connection array. The data array containing the data values and the connection array containing the information on the connections between faces and their sides.","category":"page"},{"location":"main/#The-connection-array","page":"Main","title":"The connection array","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"main/","page":"Main","title":"Main","text":"The connection array is a four-dimensional array defining the connections between faces:","category":"page"},{"location":"main/","page":"Main","title":"Main","text":"Array dimension - 1:(number of arrays)\nSpatial dimensions, size up to three - x=1, y=2, z=3\nDirection, size 2 (negative direction = 1, positive direction = 2)\nTarget - four values that point each array, dimension, and direction to its neighbor.

An attempt to get the index adjacent to a non-connected face will return NaN value.\nThe cyclic dimensions should be the last ones. For example, a 3D space problem with several faces and time dimensions should be ordered as (time, face, z, y, x). Any other dimension should come before the face dimension).\nThe z dimension is not fully implemented. Different faces can be stacked above and below, but not rotated or connected to other horizontal dimensions. Similarly, x and y dimensions cannot connect to the z dimension.\nNote that the horizontal dimensions should be equal for connection to be made between them - length(xdim) = length(ydim).","category":"page"},{"location":"main/#Examples","page":"Main","title":"Examples","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"main/#D,-1-face-example","page":"Main","title":"1D, 1 face example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"main/","page":"Main","title":"Main","text":"(Image: CyclicArrayExample1D)","category":"page"},{"location":"main/","page":"Main","title":"Main","text":"One face (size N) with one circular x dimention will have a 1x1x2x4 connection array where:   connections[1,1,:,:]=    1  1  2  0    1  1  1  0  ","category":"page"},{"location":"main/","page":"Main","title":"Main","text":"The first row (array indexes [1,1,1,:]) indicates that face one, x dimension, negative direction is pointing to face one, x-direction, positive direction.
